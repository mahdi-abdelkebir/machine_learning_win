# How can it benefit us?

It gives us the ability to learn things about our world from the huge amount of data which we as human beings can't possibly process ourselves.


# How does it do that?

## simple answer?

At first, we set a goal for the machine and then give the machines hundreds or millions of examples of data related to the subject to learn and train from.

The machine will try to find patterns in these examples and develop it's own logic, in an attempt to explain why things the way they are, sometimes even find patterns which we couldn't have possibly thought of.

For example: If the question was 'is this animal a cat or a dog?'. At first we'll give it many pictures of cats and dogs with the answers readily written to train from. From these pictures, it'll try to find patterns such as the postures, the ears, the nose, height, etc. Then if we gave it a random picture, it'll try to 'guess' the best answer based on what it previously trained.

## detailed answer?

At first, we write an ML *learning algorithm* where we'll specify a way for the machine to learn what we want it to learn.

Then, we have prepare a lot samples of data, with each example is a pair consisting of an input and the desired output.

And run our algorithm on our machine using these data, which will perform pattern recognition. and output an ML *model* compromised of *model data* and a *prediction algorithm*, to represent what was learned from the examples.

### technical terms definitions:

- Algorithm: An step-by-step procedures to be followed, in order to fulfil a certain purpose.

- Learning algorithm: A type of a type of automated programming, how to learn things.
- Labeled Data: Data consisting of a set of training examples, where each example is a pair consisting of an input and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal, labels, etc).

- Model Data: An abstract model that organizes elements of data and shows how they relate to each other and to the properties of real-world entities.
- Prediction algorithm: A procedure for using the data to make a prediction.

# In what domains can we make use of it?

Companies can use it in ads, to send better recommandations to costumers, which may possibly lead to less spending in publicity.

Spotify used it to recommand better songs by looking at what music we listened to, how much time we spent, our playlist, favourites, etc...

It could also be used to predict the weather, or where and when natural disaster like hurricanes and earthquakes will hit and how much damage they'll cause.


# What are two weaknesses of machine learning?

One. Machines may be very good at predicting based on what they seen in the past, but they need to see millions of examples to do that. Whereas, humans can easily implement something they seen only once or twice in the real-world, so we are more flexible. 

Two. Machines cannot create goals for themselves, simply because they don't have an imagination or thoughts about the future. 

They can invent new different ways, which we haven't thought of, to capitalizing unstructured data, which we gave them, to reach a specific end result. Whereas, humans are super good at inventing, we can spontanously come up with new, maybe weird, ideas. We're the ones who give these robots a purpose to fullfil.
