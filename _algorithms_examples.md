# Supervised Algorithms:

- Linear Regression
  <: Learning Algorithm: Find set of coefficients that minimize error on training dataset
  >: Model: A vector of coefficients with specific values.
  >: Prediction-Algorithm: Multiple and sum coefficients with input row.

- Decision Tree
    < Learning Algorithm*: Find set of coefficients that minimize error on training dataset
    >*Model*: a tree of if-then statements with specific values.

- Artificial Neural Network - Result in a model comprised of a graph structure with vectors or matrices of weights with specific values.
